We write the code together.
We follow the hints.
1. Fork: Checked thread.cc and addrspace.cc for how to save state.
2. Yield: Checked thread.cc and addrspace.cc for how to save state.
3. Exit: Checked processmanager.cc for how to broadcast.
4. Join: Checked processmanager.cc for status value and join function.
5. Open: Checked useropenfile.h about the variables.
6. Write: Checked openfile.cc about WriteAt() and useropenfile.h for currOffsetInFile.
7. Read: Checked openfile.cc about ReadAt() and useropenfile.h for currOffsetInFile.
8. Close: Checked sysopenfile.h, pcb.cc, useropenfile.h, openfilemanager.cc.
9. AddrSpace: Write copy constructor after read the constructor. Checked ReadFile() function for bzero and bcopy.
